Type: array Required: yes Default: - Supported diagram types: Validation: Must not be empty Each item must contain exactly one property Diagram type must be supported Example: { \"Diagrams\": [ { \"PhysicalProjectDiagram\": {} } ] } Scenarios SolutionPath is empty (Acceptance test) Given the user provides an empty SolutionPath When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': SolutionPath is required\" And the process must exit with code 4 SolutionPath does not end with .sln (Acceptance test) Given the user provides SolutionPath \"project.txt\" When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': SolutionPath must point to a .sln file\" And the process must exit with code 4 OutputDirectory is empty (Acceptance test) Given the user provides an empty OutputDirectory When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': OutputDirectory is required\" And the process must exit with code 4 OutputDirectory is not a valid path (Acceptance test) Given the user provides OutputDirectory with an invalid path (ex: containing illegal characters) When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': OutputDirectory is not a valid directory path\" And the process must exit with code 4 FileType is missing (Acceptance test) Given the user omits the FileType property When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': FileType is required\" And the process must exit with code 4 FileType does not start with a dot (Acceptance test) Given the user provides FileType \"mmd\" When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': FileType must begin with a dot\" And the process must exit with code 4 FileType is not .mmd or .md (Acceptance test) Given the user provides FileType \".pdf\" When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': FileType must be either '.mmd' or '.md'\" And the process must exit with code 4 Diagrams is empty (Acceptance test) Given the user provides an empty array for Diagrams When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': Diagrams must contain at least one item\" And the process must exit with code 4 Diagram entry contains more than one property (Acceptance test) Given a diagram entry in Diagrams contains multiple keys When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': Each diagram entry must define exactly one diagram type\" And the process must exit with code 4 Diagram type is unsupported (Acceptance test) Given the user provides an unsupported diagram type \"LogicalLayerDiagram\" When the system validates the configuration Then the console must display: \"Error: Invalid JSON in file '{path to sharpmermaidConfig.json}': Unsupported diagram type 'LogicalLayerDiagram'\" And the process must exit with code 4"
