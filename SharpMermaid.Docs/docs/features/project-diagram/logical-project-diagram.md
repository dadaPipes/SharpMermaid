# Logical Project Diagram

## Description

As a developer,  
I want to generate a diagram that accurately captures the logical arrangement of projects in the solution  
So that I can understand how projects are grouped and interconnected.

## Rules

[!INCLUDE [shared rules](shared-rules.md)]

## Scenarios

### Generate Diagram Representing Logical Structure

**Given** the solution folder contains multiple projects with dependencies  
**When** the diagram is generated  
**Then** the diagram should:

- Include nodes representing projects.
- Represent the logical hierarchy of projects and folders.
- Include arrows representing dependencies between projects.
