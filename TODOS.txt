HIGH PRIORITY:

Features:
- When clicking a project node, I should be redirected to a class diagram of the project. Including classes with all access modifiers.
  Public could be green, internal another color, and private ( do they really count ? )

Include Spectre.Console for CLI Warnings- and Error messages, and configurations.

Documentation:
Write documentation only for public classes and their public methods. Writting documentation for everything gets out of hands and wont
give much value.
Write proper XML comments for non-public classes and methods instead. Most important tags are <Description> and <Return> tags.
Because they are the only ones shown in the vs 2022 tooltip.

LOWER PRIORITY:

Features:

- When a project diagram is displayed I should be able to see the content of their <Description> tag,
  as a tooltip 
  (or just static content, if it turns out that I need to change restrictions from strict to loose to make it work,
   then reconsider to make it a configurable option).

   ### Generate Diagram With Multiple Projects and Clickable URLs and Tooltips

	Tooltips does not even work in the Mermaid Live Editor, so this one is for another time.

- Interactive links. When hovering over a project, the link/arrow should turn on animation (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html#turning-an-animation-on)
  (or just static content, if it turns out that I need to change restrictions from strict to loose to make it work,
   then reconsider to make it a configurable option).
   Thoughts:
   - Might require some custom Java Script code to handle the animation, like a hover event.

Refactor: 

Look in to // Load projects with source files into CsprojModel instances, in tests, to modify TemporarySolutionBuilder()
- Refactor the code to use the new TemporarySolutionBuilder class to load projects with source files into CsprojModel instances.
  This will make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Far future:
Automate sequence diagram:
- Start from the top (acceptence test), log the flow of the test, and then create a sequence diagram.
- Use metalama to log the flow of the test with [Log], then parse the logged data, to MermaidGenerator, to create a sequence diagram.

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:

Dockerize it. Create a .md file in a chosen location.
