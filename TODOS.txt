For tomorrow:

Assert exact warning messages.
Assert.Equals("Expected warning message", actualWarningMessage);
include the warning messeage in the Docs: Rules in "".

Kind of done above, but need to include the exact messages across docs **and** tests.

**May**

- Project nodes that has source files, **may** include a url to the projects class diagram

This should be a configurable, since there might not be anything to link to, or maybe that is not wanted or needed.
Keep in mind that it is not only DocFX that can be used to generate API documentation.
Developers might also want to link to a .cs file in a github repository or something similar.

---

Create a test project named SharpMermaid.RulesTests, for the rules of the features.
- Focus on the behavior instead of the implementation
- Unit test the rules of the features, not the implementation

HIGH PRIORITY:

Features:
- When clicking a project node, I should be redirected to a class diagram of the project. Including classes with all access modifiers.
  Public could be green, internal another color, and private ( do they really count ? )
  - Just include public.

Include Spectre.Console for CLI Warnings- and Error messages, and configurations.

Documentation:
Write documentation only for public classes and their public methods. Writting documentation for everything gets out of hands and wont
give much value.
Write proper XML comments for non-public classes and methods instead. Most important tags are <Description> and <Return> tags.
Because they are the only ones shown in the vs 2022 tooltip.

LOWER PRIORITY:

Features:

- When a project diagram is displayed I should be able to see the content of their <Description> tag,
  as a tooltip 
  (or just static content, if it turns out that I need to change restrictions from strict to loose to make it work,
   then reconsider to make it a configurable option).

   ### Generate Diagram With Multiple Projects and Clickable URLs and Tooltips

	Tooltips does not even work in the Mermaid Live Editor, so this one is for another time.

- Interactive links. When hovering over a project, the link/arrow should turn on animation (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html#turning-an-animation-on)
  (or just static content, if it turns out that I need to change restrictions from strict to loose to make it work,
   then reconsider to make it a configurable option).
   Thoughts:
   - Might require some custom Java Script code to handle the animation, like a hover event.

Refactor: 

Look in to // Load projects with source files into CsprojModel instances, in tests, to modify TemporarySolutionBuilder()
- Refactor the code to use the new TemporarySolutionBuilder class to load projects with source files into CsprojModel instances.
  This will make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Far future:
Automate sequence diagram:
- Start from the top (acceptence test), log the flow of the test, and then create a sequence diagram.
- Use metalama to log the flow of the test with [Log], then parse the logged data, to MermaidGenerator, to create a sequence diagram.

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:

Dockerize it. Create a .md file in a chosen location.
